# Week 3 tutorial

## Notices:

1. Do all the labs
   * This will ensure that you stay up-to-date with the content
   * Practice by implementing data structures we have seen so far
     and the functions associated with them

2. Assigment testing
   * Ensure you cover as many edge cases as possible
   * Make sure you also test the normal cases thoroughly
   * Use asserts

## This week's topics:

1. Time complexity analysis
   * Also space complexity
2. Binary search trees
   * How they work
   * How to insert nodes into BSTs
   * How to delete nodes from BSTs
   * How to traverse BSTs
   * How to sum all the items in a BST
   * How to search for items in a BST

## Extras

Time complexity analysis challenges:
   * TODO: To be uploaded soon (Keep an eye out for this)
