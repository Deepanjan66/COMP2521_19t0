__Short introductions__

Say:
* Your name
* Describe yourself as a person

1) I will post all the code that we write together during the tutorial and any extra snippets or exercises that I feel will help you with your learning in this repository.

> GitHub username: __deepanjan66__
> Repository name: __COMP2521_19t0__

2. If you have any questions about the tutorials, consider:
	- Posting on the respective forums on the course website
	- Sending me an email

3. You can also email me at

> deepanjan.chakrabarty@unsw.edu.au

4. Set up a group chat on slack or discord for __COMP2521_T10A__.
	- Inviting me is not necessary
	- Throw jokes at each other and stay connected throughout the summer
	- Share deadlines and helpful exercises with each other

5. Time to say goodbye to `dcc`. Welcome `3c`.
    - Use `3c +leak` instead of valgrind
    - Use gdb for debugging
    - To use on cse machines, run `2521 3c` or `2521 3c +leak`
