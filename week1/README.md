# Welcome aboard to Data Structures and Algorithms

## Introduction
```c
printf("Hello, T10A\n");
```

__Short introductions__

Say:
* Your name
* Describe yourself as a person

1) I will post all the code that we write together during the tutorial and any extra snippets or exercises that I feel will help you with your learning in this repository.

> GitHub username: __deepanjan66__
> Repository name: __COMP2521_19t0__

2. If you have any questions about the tutorials, consider:
	- Posting on the respective forums on the course website
	- Sending me an email

3. You can also email me at

> deepanjan.chakrabarty@unsw.edu.au

4. Set up a group chat on slack or discord for __COMP2521_T10A__.
	- Inviting me is not necessary
	- Throw jokes at each other and stay connected throughout the summer
	- Share deadlines and helpful exercises with each other

5. Time to say goodbye to `dcc`. Welcome `3c`.
    - Use `3c +leak` instead of valgrind
    - Use gdb for debugging
    - To use on cse machines, run `2521 3c` or `2521 3c +leak`

6. Every week I'll add extra code/resources under the `extras/` folder. 
   Have a look at them if you are interested in diving deeper into some of
   the topics discussed in the course.

## Tutorial 1

## Extra 

In this week's extra, we are looking at
   - How structs are padded in C
   - A deeper dive into the addresses stored in pointers
